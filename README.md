# About

This was a product I created around 2005 that allowed developers to draw on a canvas and produced either compatible C# or VB.NET code.  At the time there were not many great reporting options if you did not want to include a third party package.


# Warning

The code is Windows forms and old.  I have not tried to compile it since 2010.  But a number of users have toild me they still depend on this project so I am making it available here.
